## Project 4: Training a CNN/LSTM/MLP Model to Identify Joint Positions in Human Pose Videos

This project required the creation of a convolutional neural network with an LSTM module and a Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) module to detect 3D human joint positions in a sequence of video frames. The specific architecture of the model was not fixed for this assignment and hyper parameter settings could be changed and optimized. Additionally, the use of techniques to combat overfitting could be used.

The model developed by this code achieved a final Mean-Per-Joint-Position-Error (MPJPE) of 101.27mm on the validation set.
