## Project 3: Training a CNN to Classify Images Using the CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project required the creation of a convolutional neural network model to classify images of from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The structure of the model was fixed for this assignment, but hyper parameter settings could be changed and optimized. Additionally, the use of techniques to combat overfitting could be used.

The model developed by this code achieved about an 81% accuracy after being trained for 250 epochs.

For more information on the implementation, the theory applied, and techniques used to combat overfitting, please see ```Deep_Learning_Project_3_Report.pdf```.
