## Project 1: Training a Multi-class Logistic Regressor using Gradient Descent

This project required the creation of a logistic regressor model to classify images of handwritten digits 1 through 5. This task had the added constraint that **no Tensorflow gradient descent functions could be used**. All parameter updating had to be computed and applied manually.

The model developed by this code achieved about a 94% accuracy after being trained for 25 epochs.
