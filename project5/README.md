## Project 5: Training a Deep Neural Network to Recognize Human Actions in Videos

This project required the creation of a deep neural network model to recognize human actions in video data. This was the final assignment for the class, and as such it is the most open-ended. The structure and architecture of the model is not fixed, and hyper parameters can be changed and optimized as needed.

I developed a model with convolutional layers, an LSTM layer, and fully connected layers to achieve high performance and low overfitting.

The model developed by this code achieved about a 96% accuracy after being trained for 25 epochs.

For more information on the implementation, the theory applied, and techniques used to combat overfitting, please see ```Deep_Learning_Final_Project_Report.pdf```.

_Note: the ```README.txt``` file in this directory contains more information about the project, but was written as part of the project submission, and therefore most of the information will not apply to someone viewing this repository._
